# Scenario 2: AI-Enhanced Processing

## The Evolution: Adding Intelligence with Safety

### Core AI Enhancement
- **Universal content processor**: Transform any input into structured data
- **Automated classification**: Route information to optimal templates
- **Cross-reference generation**: Create relationship maps automatically
- **Quality validation**: Prevent errors through systematic checking

### Safety-First AI Implementation
```yaml
# AI Safety Rules
assumptions_prohibited:
  - financial_data: "Never assume budgets, costs, or revenue"
  - timeline_data: "Never assume deadlines or project duration"
  - technical_specs: "Never assume system requirements or architecture"

placeholder_system:
  format: "[DESCRIPTION - SOURCE/ACTION NEEDED]"
  purpose: "Replace assumptions with clarification requests"

validation_required:
  - human_review: "All critical business information"
  - source_verification: "All factual claims"
  - accuracy_checking: "All automated content"
```
